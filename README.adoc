== First Section: Build a Simpe API as an Introduction to NodeJS

What I learn in this section is well explained material to NodeJS and Learn how to build simple API using it, such as:

. What is Node JS and Why Use It? 
. Running JavaScript Outside the Browser
. Using Modules
. Basic Reading and Writing File
. Blocking and Non-Blocking: Asynchronous Nature of Node JS
. Basic Reading and Writing File Asynchronous way
. Creating a Simple Web Server
. Routing
. Build a Very Simple API
. HTML Templating: Build the Templates ad Filling the Templates 
. Parsing Variables from URLs
. Introduction to NPM and the package.json
. Type of Packages and Installs
. Package Versioning and Updating

NOTE: I will explain every single point later, maybe :D, it's my own notes anyway :b

== Second Section: Introduction to Back-End Web Development

In this section I learn about basic knowledge how Web works, HTTP and others, such as:

. An Overview of How the Web is Works
. HTTP in Action
. Front-End vs. Back-End Web Development 
. Static vs Dynamic vs API

NOTE: same as above (:

== How Node JS Works: A Look Behind the Scenes

This Section is actually more deep explained about how Node JS work behind the scenes, such as:

. Node, V8, Libuv and C++ +
Node JS is actually built with V8 engine (not a car engine) from Google using Libuv Library and Using C++ Programming Language

. Processes, Threads and Thread Pool +
From what i get from this Section, Node JS is Single threated application, meaning that Node JS is just using 1 (one) thread to handle request. And using Thread Pool (Thread that Node JS use to actually process the request(process it in background (honestly I don't really know about this, maybe I will repeat this section again later)))

. The Node JS Event Loop

. Events and Event-Driven Architecture

. Introduction to Streams +
Streams is used to read a large amount of data, such as large file, video, etc.

. How Requiring Modules Really Works

== Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises and Async/Await

From this section, I learn about how callback can ruin our code. 

. The Problem with Callbacks: Callbacks Hell +
Here is the Example: +
+
[source, javascript]
----
fs.readdir(source, function (err, files) {
  if (err) {
    console.log('Error finding files: ' + err)
  } else {
    files.forEach(function (filename, fileIndex) {
      console.log(filename)
      gm(source + filename).size(function (err, values) {
        if (err) {
          console.log('Error identifying file size: ' + err)
        } else {
          console.log(filename + ' : ' + values)
          aspect = (values.width / values.height)
          widths.forEach(function (width, widthIndex) {
            height = Math.round(width / aspect)
            console.log('resizing ' + filename + 'to ' + height + 'x' + height)
            this.resize(width, height).write(dest + 'w' + width + '_' + filename, function(err) {
              if (err) console.log('Error writing file: ' + err)
            })
          }.bind(this))
        }
      })
    })
  }
})
----

+
So the point in this section is how to avoid the above Example.

. From Callback Hell to Promises
. Consuming Promises with Async/Await
. Returning Values from Async Functions
. Waiting for Multiple Promises Simultaneously

== Express: Start Building an API

. What is Express? +
Express is framework for Node JS to build a web application. The short is this module can make our application build process a little bit easier then without using it.

. Postman Intro +
Postman is an application to access and test our API. 

. Setting up Express and Basic Routing. +
In this section the lecturer explain about how to actually using Express and setup a basic routing using it.
